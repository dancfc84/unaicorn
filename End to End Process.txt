- Get website working locally - HTML, CSS, Django, JavaScript
- AWS EC2 - Set up a server for hosting our website. Use git and Linux to upload website
- Linux used to configure our Django settings for browser access - Get website live
- Use Gunicorn and Nginx to keep website running by its self - Don't have to keep saying run server in linux...
- Use google domains to purchase a domain and make website live


AWS EC2 - Elasticated 
--------

- We need to setup the website on a remote computer, so website is always availiable if required
- Select launch instance
- Select OS - Select free tier one
- make sure you have London selected top right
- Select memeory options - free tier (for now)
- Create new keys, save file somewhere safe
- The instance Takes two minutes to create 

- CD to the folder where the keys are stored and run - ssh -i ubantu-key-london.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-133-222-129.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com - # This will vary depending on instance

- Note -i means we arre stipulating the security key

- You will then be in Ubuntu, commands such as, pwd will work now

- Can use putty instead


Moving ML models between machines
---------------------------------

- See video if required


Transferring files onto AWS
---------------------------

- Can use WinSCP - FTP or SFTP or CMD


See earlier documentation on git for early commands
